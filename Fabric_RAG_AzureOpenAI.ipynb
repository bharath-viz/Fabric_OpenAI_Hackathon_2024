Study Status:NOT_YET_RECRUITING . Brief Summary:Lung cancer is one of the most diagnosed cancer types worldwide, according to GLOBOCAN data published in 2020. According to these data, lung cancer comes second after breast cancer with 2,206,771 new diagnoses worldwide in 2020.\\n\\nAccording to Türkiye's data for 2020, 41,264 new lung cancer diagnoses made. Lung cancer tumors are divide into two main histological groups non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and small cell lung cancer (SCLC).\\n\\nCurrent medical treatment methods for lung cancer are surgical resection, chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and targeted therapies. Cancer treatments can be administered as a combination of these methods appropriately selected for patients.\\n\\nAdvances in treatment methods in recent years have increased survival and prolonged life expectancy. However, these treatment methods may affect patients in various areas from functional independence to quality of life.\\n\\nCancer treatments can cause various cognitive impairments such as memory, executive functions, and concentration.\\n\\nIn particular, a significant number of cancer patients receiving chemotherapy report cognitive disturbances that include attention problems, memory loss, and mixed thought processes ('chemobrain' or 'chemofog?), often accompanied by mood disorders and fatigue.\\n\\nDespite recent large cohort studies using neuropsychological testing and neuroimaging in cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy, it remains unclear whether cognitive deficits are due to treatment, cancer itself, and/or psychological factors.\\n\\nPatients with cognitive impairment due to chemotherapy reported that they had difficulty performing and completing simple tasks such as preparing meals, keeping track of bills and paying, or getting ready to go out, and needed additional time to perform these tasks.\\n\\nThey may also find it difficult to perform necessary work-related tasks and then need to change jobs or cease employment altogether.\\n\\nTherefore, treatment-related cognitive impairment can have a significant impact on cognitive, occupational, and social functioning, all of which can result in significant personal problems and, in many cases, reduced quality of life.\\n\\nDuring daily activities, we often need to perform multiple tasks at the same time. These tasks are usually cognitive and motor tasks.\\n\\nA dual-task is the simultaneous execution of two tasks that have different objectives and can performed independently. In this case, attention should be focused on two tasks at the same time. These tasks can be measured separately.\\n\\nDeteriorated cognitive function due to cancer and its treatments can affect the dual-task performance of individuals in their daily lives and reduce their quality of life.\\n\\nRespiratory symptoms can be seen in lung cancer and post-cancer survival. Cancer itself and treatments can affect the cardiorespiratory system.\\n\\nConsidering that the number of individuals living with lung cancer increases every year, the evaluation of dual-task performance and respiratory muscle endurance, which is related to the cognitive status of individuals, and if necessary, adding them to the rehabilitation program can reduce the symptoms of individuals and increase their quality of life. .

Acronym:TRIO . Study Status:RECRUITING . Brief Summary:Lung cancer is the leading cause of mortality in the world, and also in Taiwan.Despite the researches and availability in new therapies, it causes the highest mortality and is one of the most preventable cancers as well. Smoking is the most common cause of lung cancer worldwide. Compared to lung cancer in smokers, lung cancer in never-smokers is associated with East Asian ethnicity, female sex, and adenocarcinoma histology. This unique risk group is likely to have distinct molecular drivers, especially EGFR, ALK, and ROS1 mutations.In National Taiwan Cancer Registry data, more than half (53%) of all newly diagnosed lung cancer patients and 93% of female patients are lifelong never-smokers. This scenario is common in East Asia. It is essential to develop a different strategy for screening lung cancer patients with other high-risk profiles. Several risk factors have been identified in never-smoking lung cancer and one of the most important factor is a lung cancer family history (LCFH) in a first-degree relative. Other high-risk occupational or environmental factors include air-pollution exposed occupations (such as traffic policeman and street cleaners) for at least 10 years, cooking index ≥ 110, defined as 2/7 \\\\* days cooking by pan frying, stir frying, or deep frying in one week \\\\* years cooking, cooking without using ventilation, passive smoke exposure, and history of pulmonary tuberculosis or chronic obstructive pulmonary disorders.\\n\\nAs described above, three high risk groups are interested in this study, the previous heavy smokers (group 1); those who has family history (group 2) and those who have high risk occupation or environment factors (group 3). From the published researches, we assume the detection rate to be 1.1% for group 1 based on NLST results16, 2.6% for group 2 (395 out of 12,011 subjects in TALENT), and we assume the detection Group 3 to be 1% after consulting board-certified senior specialists in this field.\\n\\nThis is a prospective, multi-center, single arm study in Taiwan of subjects who are eligible to receive LDCT screening based on recommendation of Health Promotion Administration of Taiwan.\\n\\nThe primary objective of TRIO part A is the LDCT screening acceptance rate of high lung cancer risk subjects.\\n\\nThe primary objective of TRIO part B is the exact lung cancer detection rates in these three groups.\\n\\nOther secondary objectives are also included. .

Acronym:FORMOSA . Study Status:RECRUITING . Brief Summary:Lung Cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths in Taiwan and worldwide and the incidence is also increasing. The payment for lung cancer which occupies the largest part of National Health Insurance expense is over 15 billion in 2018. Because about 80% lung cancer patients are smokers in western countries the low-dose computed tomography screening focuses on the smoking population It is quite different in South-East Asia particularly in Taiwan that 53% of Taiwan lung cancer are never-smokers and the etiology and the underlying mechanisms are still unknown. The preliminary results of prospective TALENT study indicated that family history plays a key role in tumorigenesis of Taiwan lung cancers but several important variables such as air pollution, biomarkers, radiomics analysis are not available limits the accuracy of lung cancer identification. Hence, it is critical to integrate most of factors involved in lung cancer formation into a multidimensional lung cancer prediction model which could benefit never-smoker lung cancers in Taiwan and East Asia even in the western countries. The investigators initiate a clinical study to validate the multidimensional lung cancer prediction model for never-smoking population by multicenter prospective study. . Study Results:NO . Conditions:Lung Cancer . Interventions:OTHER: LDCT lung cancer screen, immediately|OTHER: LDCT lung cancer screen, later . Primary Outcome Measures:Lung cancer detection rate differences between the high lung cancer risk group and the low lung cancer risk group., Participants will receive the following things in sequence\\n\\n1. 10,000 non-smoker participants will receive a prespecified questionnaire\\n2. Autoantibodies will be checked including p53, NY-ESO-1, CAGE, GBU4-5, HuD, MAGE A4, and SOX2 in the blood of recruited participants. All 133 SNPs and 11 mitochondrial mutations will be detected which are highly correlated with never-smoking lung cancer in our preliminary data\\n3. In the high-risk group, the investigators will arrange LDCT scans for four rounds to determine the lung cancer detection rate. Also, the pulmonary nodule lesions detected will be classified by Lung-RADS and prediction of lung cancer risk in CT scans using deep learning and radiomics. In the low-risk group, the matched participants will receive LDCT scans for two rounds to determine the lung cancer detection rate., 4 years|Predicted Area under curve (AUC) value > 0.8 of the lung cancer risk model, Through steps 1,2, and 3 of the above column in primary outcome 1, the lung cancer risk model will be developed with optimization and validation of lung cancer risk and probability prediction model by this prospective multicenter study.\\n\\n( predicted Area under curve (AUC) \\\\> 0.8), 4 years .

Brief Summary:Lung cancer is the second most common cancer in Austria with 2.868 men and 2.009 women diagnosed in 2016. Reflecting the high mortality of this disease, 2.415 men and 1.534 women died from lung cancer. Therefore, lung cancer is the most common reason for cancer associated death in men and second most common reason in women.\\n\\nThis malignant disease can be divided into two main groups: small cell lung cancer (SCLC) and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). NSCLC is a paradigm for personalized medicine, with an increasing number of targetable gene alterations. Despite this growing diversity of molecular subtypes, in most patients no targetable mutation can be detected. For these patients check-point inhibitors with or without chemotherapy is the mainstay of the initial tumor therapy. Until recently, little progress has been made in the treatment of SCLC in last decades. Recently, an overall survival benefit by the addition of an immune-checkpoint inhibitor to first-line chemotherapy for advanced SCLC has been reported.\\n\\nDespite the progress in the treatment of NSCLC, the performance of predictive biomarkers is weak. Therefore, the development of more precise prediction models is of great importance for the progress of personalized treatment strategies. . Study Results:NO .

Study URL:https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05683977 . Acronym:ARSENAL . Study Status:RECRUITING . Brief Summary:Small cell lung cancer (SCLC), characterized by rapid proliferation, high growth fraction and early development of metastases, is the most aggressive form of lung cancer. In 2021, an estimated 2.3 million people around the world are diagnosed with lung cancer. In France, in 2018, with 46 363 new cases and 33 117 deaths, lung cancer represented the second most common cancer and the first cause of death from cancer. Among those, SCLC represented 10,8% of all new lung diagnosis, and about two thirds presented at the extensive stage (ES-SCLC).\\n\\nSince last three decades, standard treatment in ES-SCLC is based on combination chemotherapy with a platinum agent and etoposide in first-line with or without concurrent radiation therapy. Then, the second-line of treatment is topotecan, with few results in terms of response rates and survival rate. However, the emergence of immune checkpoint inhibitors targeting the programmed cell death receptor-1 (PD-1)/PD-ligand 1 (PD-L1) pathway, having an important role in immune regulation became an alternative method in the management and care of disease. Indeed, recent studies have shown an overall survival (OS) benefit for patients with ES-SCLC treated in first line with a combination of platinum-etoposide and immune checkpoint inhibitors. Atezolizumab (Tecentriq®, Roche) and durvalumab (Imfinzi®, AstraZeneca), two anti-Programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) antibodies, delivered positive phase III results, respectively through the Impower-133 and CASPIAN studies, and were granted European market authorisations.\\n\\nDurvalumab is approved for use in combination with etoposide and either carboplatin or cisplatin for the first-line treatment of patients with ES-SCLC. On March 10, 2020 French health authorities allowed durvalumab utilization in this setting through a national \"early access program\" (Autorisation Temporaire d\\'Utilisation \"de cohorte\" - ATUc), thus preceding the European market authorization (August 28, 2020). Since 2020 October 1st, durvalumab is used as a post ATU treatment. Since 2020, French AURA treatment guidelines for SCLC have referenced durvalumab in combination with chemotherapy as a first-line treatment option for patients with ES-SCLC.\\n\\nWhereas the safety and efficacy of the durvalumab have been evaluated in a clinical trial, data are required to further evaluate the use of durvalumab in real-life condition and in less selected population than in clinical trials. . Study Results:NO . Conditions:Small Cell Lung Carcinoma . Interventions:DRUG: durvalumab . Primary Outcome Measures:The time to first line treatment discontinuation (TTD)., For patients who start durvalumab at a later cycle than first cycle PE, the index date will be the first infusion of PE.\\n\\nIf the treatment is stopped during the first phase of 4 to 6 cycles (induction) with a new re- start of durvalumab and PE, the treatment will be considered as temporary stop. If the treatment is stopped during the durvalumab maintenance with a re-start of durvalumab in monotherapy, the treatment will be also considered as temporary stop.\\n\\nDurvalumab will be considered definitely discontinued when the maintenance phase with durvalumab in monotherapy is stopped and results in a new administration of PE (+/-durvalumab) (subsequent treatment line).\\n\\nFor patients still receiving durvalumab at the end of follow-up or when they are lost to follow-up, TTD will be right-censored at the last recorded day of ongoing durvalumab treatment., TTD is defined as the time from the index date to the date of last durvalumab infusion (+3 weeks during induction period and +4 weeks during maintenance period) or date of death (up to 36 months)). .

Study URL:https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06196424 . Acronym:FAHIC-Lung . Study Status:RECRUITING . Brief Summary:Germline testing to find genetic alteration that can be linked to inherited susceptibility of developing the disease is recommended for patients diagnosed with certain solid cancers, such as breast, prostate and ovarian, due to strong association with inheritable mutations implying familiar counselling. Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) is the leading cancer-related cause of death and smoking habitude is the main modifiable risk, while environmental factors, such as radon, asbestosis and fine polluting particles account for most diagnoses among never or light smokers. At the same time, the relative risk (RR) of lung cancer correlates with the number of relatives diagnosed with lung cancer.\\n\\nA recent study of 7788 patients with NSCLC who receiving a germline testing described a prevalence of genetic alterations linked to inherited susceptibility of cancer in 14.9% of cases, highlighting the potential role of genetic However, all the available studies investigating the family history of cancer among patients with NSCLC are retrospective and do not consider modifiable risk factors such as smoking, working habits and geographical origins.\\n\\nThe objective of this study is the detailed description of the family history of cancer among patients with NSCLC and the description of distribution of other risk factors, such as smoking, among the study participants, in order to establish whether there are specific family history clusters that can help clinicians in directing patients to genetic counselling.\\n\\nThe study will enrol consecutive patients with NSCLC, independently from age, disease stage, smoking status, and clinic-pathological characteristics.\\n\\nParticipants will provide clinical anamnestic information filling an ad hoc self-reported study questionnaire, internally validated by the genetic expert of the steering committee. Data of interest include: Family history of cancer; Type of tumours/primary tumour site among relatives with history of cancer; Age at diagnosis among relatives with history of cancer; Biological sex of relatives with history of cancer; Exposure to tobacco smoking and smoking habits among relatives with history of cancer; Geographical origin of participants and relatives with history of cancer; Personal history of multiple malignancies; Potential professional and environmental exposure to carcinogens of participants and relatives with history of cancer; Ethnicity of both participants and relatives with history of cancer.\\n\\nThe study does not require any additional hospital access from the patients since the questionnaire will be returned at the following planned clinical consultation to minimize recall bias.\\n\\nThe investigators will collect the following clinic-pathologic characteristics: Smoking status (active/passive, package/year, total years of smoking); Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status (ECOG-PS); Age at diagnosis; Tumour histology; Tumour stage at diagnosis according to the 8th edition of TNM staging system; Ethnicity; Professional and environmental exposure to carcinogens; Programmed death ligand-1 tumour proportion score (PD - L1 TPS); Any available oncogenic drivers including epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), Kirsten rat sarcoma virus (KRAS), BRAF, c-MET, mutations and Anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK), ROS-1, RET, neurotrophic tyrosine receptor kinase NTRK translocation/gene fusions; Personal history of other synchronous/metachronous primary malignancies. .

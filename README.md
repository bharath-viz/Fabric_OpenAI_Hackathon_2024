# Clinical Trial Finder

Welcome to Clinical Trial Finder! This project aims to provide a user-friendly interface for patients suffering from diseases to discover clinical trials matching their needs and preferences. Leveraging Fabric and OpenAI's Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) approach, our solution offers natural language interaction, allowing users to express their queries in everyday language.
